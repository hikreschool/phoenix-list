# App Challenge Week 7 - Phoenix Checklists
Deadline: Friday

Download the starter project files as .zip and extract to your desktop or your folder of preference.

Or you can go your Terminal or Commandline and copy paste: git clone https://github.com/hikreschool/phoenix-list

**Important: You will be using what you've learned from both App Challenge #1 (Oblique Strategies) and App Challenge # 2 (Phoenix Profiles)**

# What You Will Be Using
1. UINavigationController
2. UITableViewController
3. Table View CustomCells
4. Intro Delegate and Protocol methods

# Important keywords
1. **IndexPath** - Index paths describe an item’s position inside a table view or collection view, storing both its section and its position inside that section. For example, the first row in a table would have section 0, row 0, whereas the eighth row in the fourth section would have section 3, row 7. You’ll be given index paths fairly frequently by iOS, for example when the user tapped on a row, or when UIKit needs to know whether a certain item can be edited.

2. **What are the differences between Rows and Cells?** - Cells contain labels, images, etc. There are as many rows as your data source items. Cells are reused and shown only in rows that are visible. A row is a place: e.g., section 0, row 3.

3. Table View CustomCells: https://www.ralfebert.de/ios-examples/uikit/uitableviewcontroller/custom-cells/

# Notes
1. This apps presents more thinking challenge in comparison the previous app challenges
2. Some boilerplate code is already implemented for you 
3. Storyboard VCs are already implemented for you

# How To Start
1. Open the project and get familiar with it
2. Write Pseudocode for your approach on a piece of paper or iPad (human-readable language)
3. Start writing code (start small and divide and conquer)
4. Start on simple tasks like UI-related code
5. THen, proceed with the logic of the app
6. Be mindful on doing one particular task at a time
